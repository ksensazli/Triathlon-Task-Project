# Triathlon Task Project

Hello,<br />

In this task project I made for you, I tried to develop a terminal-based C++ application by applying the commands you gave.
I chose to develop with C++ because CudaC++ is an area I am not familiar with and because I do not own any device with an nVidia graphics card.
But in the meantime, I researched what could be done with CudaC++ and tried to at least have an idea about the subject.<br />

Below are the computers and tools I used while developing the project:<br />
-MacBook Pro 2021 (Apple M1 Pro Chip)<br />
-CLion 2023.3.4 (for MacOS)<br />
-MacOS Sonoma 14.4.1
